# ConsumptionPrediction

In this project, the dataset includes the username and hourly energy usage. 

By using MLP algorithm, the system can predict the patter of usage for future day, month or year based on user's request.

This is a part of IoT home automation platform and the datasets are confidential to share, but you can create a dataset in a csv file to run.
